# Playwright Practice Project

This repository hosts a Playwright practice project built using TypeScript. In this repository, I practiced test automation using Playwright and TypeScript and used two resources.

## Resources

- [Automation Panda Playwright Repository](https://github.com/AutomationPanda/awesome-web-testing-playwright)
  - followed step by step instructions from this repo
- [Sample Trello Project Repository](https://github.com/filiphric/trelloapp-vue-vite-ts)
  - developed and executed tests for this repo locally

## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to use [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) with TypeScript for test automation. It includes sample tests, setup instructions, and a GitHub Actions workflow to automate the test execution.
